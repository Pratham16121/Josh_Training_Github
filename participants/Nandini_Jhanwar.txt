Hey There!
I am Nandini Jhanwar pursuing Btech in CSIT branch from Symbiosis University of Applied Sciences, Indore.
Today was my first day of training and i learnt the basic commands of git. The video lecture was pretty good and elaborative with commands.
I liked it and looking forward to the second day of training.

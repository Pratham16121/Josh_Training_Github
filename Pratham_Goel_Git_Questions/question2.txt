Ques 2
We can make a new remote by the command
git remote add <remote_name> <link for the repository>
Eg: git remote add newRemote https://github.com/Pratham16121/Josh_Training_Github.git

Use case for this command can be when we are working on multiple git repositories and we have to keep the sync available in all the repositories.
